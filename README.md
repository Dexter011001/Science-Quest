# Parking System Model for Science Quest Competion

###Description

This is the code for a Science Fair competition I helped with. The project was a small automated parking system with LEDs, motors , sensors , a small display to indicate number 
of cars and it worked with an Arduino.

When a small toy car would approach the parking gate, the sensor would detect its presence and a motor would open the gate. Then when the car finds a parking space, 
another sensor reads it from below and the number of parking space available is updated on a display screen.

### Technolgies used

Most of the code was written in C since the project worked with an arduino.
